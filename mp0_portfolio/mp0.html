      <h1>MP0 Writeup</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
            <div>
                <p>
                    First, I have accepted the homework and starting to build off more contents from the given template. The first thing I want to explore is to change the pictures from the template. 
                    Therefore, I have analyzed the way that templates were set up and looked up how were the pictures inserted. Then, I have successfully inserted my own pictures into the page.
                </p>
                <img 
                class="list_picture"
                src="/Images/intro page.jpg"
                alt="A screen shot of the intro page with black background and my picture"
                />
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div><p> Then, I decided to implement a navigation bar that navigate to all the required pages for this particular assignment. I have done some google searches
            to learn about how to create navigation bar and the corresponding CSS style sheet, along with how to direct to the corresponding page after
            clicking the link in the navigation bar. Therefore, I have also created the individual placeholder pages that can be directed to, with the consistency of general styles. 
            Since I am editing on the navigation bar, I have also decided to change the font of the naviation bar word font with 
            some tutorials that I have found on Google. </p>
            <img 
            class="list_picture"
            src="/Images/basic navigation.png"
            alt="the navigation on the top of the page with a black background"
            />
        </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Then, I started to investigate the overall design of the page, especially what are background color of the page and what fond should I use for these pages. Specifically, I am trying
                    to implement colors and fonts that are not default in CSS. Therefore, I have looked up how to use Google font and other special color that I have generated using the color generation tool. Then,
                    I have made sure that the style is being consistent across all the pages so that they share the same asethetic. 
                </p>
                <img
                class="list_picture"
                src="/Images/home page.png"
                alt="the home page with yellow background and four pictures of lightbulb in the middle of the pae"
                />
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, I started to actually filling in all the contents into individual pages so that it has all the contents that is required for this assignment.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Issues</h2>
      <p>One biggest issue that I had was the HTML sytax issue. My natural intuition is to keep writing code and paragraph as long as the content is going to continue downward, but the output
        usually looks very messy or not showing up as what I wanted. Therefore, I have later learned more tags within html, such as "li" and "body" tags, and how to wrap paragraph and image inside one
        "div" so that they appear grouped together. </p>
      <h2>CSS Transition</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
            I have embedded three CSS transition. The first one is the background color change on the home page when the user hover their mouse into the webpage. This is a welcoming effect and separates out the the navigation bar
            and the background contents to give a fresh impression to the user. The other two are just the hover effect when the user hover their mouse onto an item to give the indication that the link/picture is clickable. Specifically,
            the user can hover over the option on the navigation bar and the background color of the option will change.  Another one is when the user hover over the picture to a project or the WP0 writeup, the picture background brightness
            will change to show the clickable indication. I have made these transitions by adding the .hover and .focus aspects into the CSS sheets and specified the transition time that I desire to happen.
        </p>
        <img
        class="list_picture"
        src="/Images/screen record.gif"
        alt="A gif of the background color transit from dark blue to lighter yellow"
        />
      </div>
      <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
            I want to transfer some projects from my current portfolio into this new portfolio that I just made. In another word, I am thinking about taking out the placeholder for the project and put in the
            content for the acual project that I want to showcase of. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I want to add the feature where the entire background is under animation and having moving effect. Then, based on where the user place their mouse cursor, there will be a special animation targeting
            that specific area
