            <h1>Final Project Prototype</h1>
            <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
            <p>
                This to-do planner is a implementation of the paper planner/to-do list but the user can simply keep track of their daily commitments on through this website. This to-do 
                planner is built with "React" framework and currently achieve the basic functionality. The users can add new to-do items in the input box which will be queued at the end of the list,
                and the user can delete the task or toggle the checkbox to mark the task as done. Based on the amount of the remaining tasks, the website will remind users
                how many remaining tasks are left inside the to-do list.  <br><br>

                To experience this virtual to-do planner, you may access it from <a href = "https://hanfeng5.github.io/p5_game/">To-Do-Planner Prototype</a>

            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            First, I have spent a lot of time to understand the React framework. I decided to experiment with the React framework because I want to be familiar with an additional tool besides the basic
                            Javascript. I have read through a lot of the command lines and tutorial on the <a href="https://reactjs.org">React offical webstie</a> and figuring out what are the tools I needed for this project.
                            This is also where I have established the React environmenmt by using the command <strong>"npx create-react-app to-do-planner" </strong>.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Then, I started the actual implementation process. And this is the longest step in this project process becuase I have no prior experiences with React and 
                            I am still getting familiarzed with Javascript syntax. Then, I have been following the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_getting_started">MDN Tutorial</a>
                            to get started with the "to-do-planner" implementation and the baic React environment set up to render a simple to-do planner interface. At this step, I am not yet looking to add/remove to do list or having any concrete
                            functionality yet but rather setting up the back end of the program. Most of the code and user interface were handled inside the App.py function and mostly written out with hard coded HTMl contents.
                        </p>

                        class="list_picture"
                        src="/Images/fp1 prototype/Initial.jpg"/>
                        <div class="image-title">Interface only without functionality</div>
                        <br>
                        <img
                        class="list_picture"
                        src="/Images/fp1 prototype/fp1 1.png"/>
                        <div class="image-title">A hard coded list of to-do items</div>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Finally, I have put in a lot of time to fix the actual to-do list functionality. For this prototype, I have only been mostly focused on adding and deleting the task and keep track of how many tasks are remained inside the list. 
                            To complete this step, I have been reading a lot about passing around "props" around different files and how to modify the list of tasks through different built in functions, such as "useState", ".filter()" methods and so on. 
                            Finally, I have succesffully manuplated the list of task and make them display in the user interface while tracking how many tasks is remained in the list.

            </ol>
            <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
            <p>
                One issue happened when I was attemtping to use the "useState" function within React to change the state of the variable and pass it into a function to change the original value of the variable.
                When I was reading about this function, I wanted to pair it with another "function" so that the program will add the task when the user hit the "add" button on the to-do list. However, when I wrote out the function,
                I have been constantly getting the error of scope not found. I have gotten some help from Hannah and understand the "class" and "function" logic within Javascript. I was very used to other coding languages where a function, or a method,
                is exclusive to itslef with the return statement to end the method. However, instead of writing the component files with the "class" keyword and extend the React library, we can write the object as a large function. Then, there can be 
                sub functions inside so that other variables can access to the scope. 
            </p>

            <h2>Additional Project Clarifaction</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Project Scope:</strong> The biggest scope change is that I will not be able to implement any sync feature in my final deliverable as user log into their calendar account. For now,
                I am trying to make sure the to-do planner has all the basic functionality and user centered control for a virtual planner. My biggest challenge in the final deliverable scope is to figure out a way
                for the website to remember the user's input even after user have closed the browser window or refreshed the page. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>Time Management:</strong> This project has been taking longe than I expected since I have been spending most the time to understand the logistics of React and how to use different functions within Javascript. However, the time and efforts
                are still manageable as I have been trying to only utilize aspects that are relevant to this project and temporarily skipped the details of a few functions for React. The biggest setbacks is that I do not understand some syntax and code
                in the tutorials, which means that I had to Google these code and read the documentation of what does the syntax mean within Javascript or React. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>Implementation Plan:</strong> My implementation plan has changed a bit since the project scope has changed. Becuase I will not be implmeneting the account syncing function and I have realized that there are a lot of new syntax I need to
                learn within React and Javascript, I will shift my focus to complete the basic functionality of this virtual to-do planner. Quality over quantity. Please refer to
                <strong>Ideas and Future Work</strong> section down below for more details regarding my future implementation plan.
            </p>
            <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
            <p>
                Looking ahead, I definitley want add in additional functionality within the to-do planner. For example, some top priority functionality includes editing the existing task and save the to-do list
                for a later use so that the user do not lose their to-do list once they close the window or refresh the page. This memory functionality will takes me more time to do researches and potentially use authentication
                mechanism so that it is stored to the user's account. Additionally, I want to gather some inputs from my colleagues about how to properly handle the check box for each task. For now, the user can toggle the check box and send in
                proper state information in the back end but nothing happens in the user interface. I want to explore how can I implement these checkbox so that it will be more benefical for the user in addition to the delete button.
            </p>
            <h2>Kudos</h2>
            <p>
                I have used a lot of resources for this assignment. For most of the project, I have been following this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_getting_started">MDN Tutorial</a>
                to get started and push through the logistics of building a to-do planner in React. From there, I have also developed some unique functionality based on the starter code and the code snippets from the tutorial. This
                tutorial is extremely helpful for me to explore React and learn about the logics to pass around different components, and that is how I can further implement the functionality after I have understand the logics and syntaxs. 
                <br>
                Additionally, I would love to thank my peer Frannie Ello, Andy Shaw, and Ryan Bautista for the debugging helps. Also, thank you Hannah for discussing with me about React and clarify the logistics or React during class.
